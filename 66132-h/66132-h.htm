<i>A Critical and Biographical Sketch</i>
</p>

<p class="t3b">
By HERVEY ALLEN
</p>

<p>
There was a fashion amongst a certain school
of critics and <i>literati</i> of former years to go
about the country with dark lanterns ready to
flash their microscopic spot lights upon this or that
author, as he emerged for a brief moment from the
great North American obscurity, and to proclaim that
he had or certainly would or could write the great
American novel.  It was then the custom to say that
in poem or story he had caught the essential verities
of the great universal American type.  For a while
the little spotlights would play hopefully upon
someone, and then be turned elsewhere.  At last, like the
gentleman from Athens who searched with a lantern
for another equally mythical person, the critics, who
were looking for the great American novelist and his
novel, passed away with the hope which animated
them, and were seen and heard no more.
</p>

<p>
Through the 1890's and 1900's the steam-roller of
an industrial democracy continued its leveling and
standardizing processes which few outstanding literary
personalities were able to resist.  Then the American
writers and critics at large, especially since the World
War, may be said to have suddenly realized, indeed to
have discovered, two startling but paradoxical facts,
<i>i.e.</i>, that at last there was a typical and very standard
American type, but that he or she was not altogether a
desirable person, and secondly and by contrast, that the
country was not just one level, usual United States,
but in reality a union of many different localities with
varying backgrounds, traditions, and philosophies.  Out
of these provincial cultures might be expected to come
the variants from the standardized types, variants
whose differences were not only picturesquely or
quaintly interesting, but of essential human value.
</p>

<p>
It is on these two themes, either that of standardization
or of sectional difference in character, that the
major utterance of creative literature in America during
the past decade or so has busied itself both in poetry
and prose.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sinclair Lewis may be said to have achieved
the characterization par excellence of the standardized
America in <i>Main Street</i> and <i>Babbit</i>.  Of the studies
of sectional and provincial types there have been many
poor and a few fine ones in prose.  In poetry, Robert
Frost and Edwin Arlington Robinson have been most
distinguished in dealing with New England.  In the
drama Eugene O'Neil has frequently found his finest
<i>m√©tier</i> in the provincial.
</p>

<p>
Peculiarly tempting, to those artists who have
desired to present the more extreme provincial types of
character, has been the wide field of the South, "Uncle
Sam's Other Country", where the feudal tradition of
the plantation, the isolated Mountain Whites, or the
realm of the negro have successively, but not always
successfully, engaged various pens.  A host of names
in this connection might be quoted both of authors and
of titles, many of which would be familiar.
</p>

<p>
In the last few years, the negro, owing largely to
the fact that his emigration in large numbers northward
has suddenly called him to the attention of our
metropolitan writers&mdash;who now find that he is a reality
in their midst instead of a romantic myth or a minstrel
character&mdash;the negro thus, has become the preoccupation
of innumerable writers in prose and poetry, but
more especially in music.
</p>

<p>
It is no exaggeration to say, and not a derogation
for the purpose of argument to admit, that in the final
analysis most of those who have essayed the task of
depicting provincial conditions in the South, involving
the essentially differing peculiarities of minor Southern
localities where the plantation, industrialism, the negro,
and the Mountain White are all factors&mdash;it is we
repeat, no derogation to say that for the most part those
who have attempted to handle these themes in a major
literary way have fallen short of the mark.
</p>

<p>
This situation has largely arisen from the fact that
only those who were natives of the South could understand
the genuine realities of the conditions they
undertook to depict.  Yet there was another complication,
those who were born in the South by the traditions of
their birthright were often inhibited from assuming an
attitude toward their own section, one that is
necessary to project a work of art.  This attitude may be
described as that of the "intimately-detached".
</p>

<p>
Such was very largely the condition of present day
American letters in regard to matters "South" when
in 1925 Mr. Du Bose Heyward of Charleston, S.C.,
contributed his comment on the negro.  The scene of
the story is laid in one of the oldest plantation
communities on the continent slowly melting from its former
outlines in the crucible of "progress".
</p>

<p>
The Book <i>Porgy</i>* (the "g" is hard as in "gate")
may be said to have combined or expanded the highly
wrought technique of the best type of realistic
dramatic short story with the more ponderable bulk of the
novel, and from the standpoint of diction to have
attained with a natural felicity all the dignity and beauty
of a highly-wrought style.  Its early appearance was
greeted with acclaim, and the first glow of enthusiasm
was sustained and enhanced by the more judicious and
pondered praise of careful critics.  <i>Porgy</i>, indeed is the
first American novel about the American negro which
depicts him faithfully, as he exists in a particular place,
and yet presents him as a purely artistic but faithfully
realistic study of a phase of human life.  Mr. Heyward
and his first novel were thus a nice example of a
particular environment producing an artist peculiarly
capable of exploiting the intriguing differences of his
province in universal terms.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "Porgy", the name given to Mr. Heyward's hero by the
colored fishermen who lived in and about Cat-fish Row and
plied their trade by sailing out of Charleston harbor to the
black-fish banks, is the local name for black-fish, hence the
derivation of the nickname.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The author was born and raised in Charleston, S.C.
He first saw the light in August, 1885, inheriting from
a long line of Revolutionary and Colonial ancestry the
essential American traditions and the philosophy of
aristocratic planters nurtured upon almost feudal
plantations.
</p>

<p>
In the late 1880's and throughout the 1890's the
South as a whole, particularly the "Carolina Low
Country" about Charleston, was still in the throes of
the aftermath of Reconstruction.  Mr. Heyward's
family, like thousands of others, had lost their property
as a result of the Civil War, and he was from the first
forced to confront not only an extreme private poverty
but the then all but hopeless economic condition of his
section.  At an early age he became the sole support of
his widowed mother and struggled manfully and
hopefully against "a sea of troubles".
</p>

<p>
Yet there was a fortunate side to all this, one then
difficult to see, but present nevertheless.  The very
difficulties of the place into which he had been born
forced the future chronicler of its charms and
grotesqueness into an intimate contact with the life of the
locality, and permitted him to drink it in through
understanding eyes.  The aftermath of the Civil War
had put a premium upon living for being rather than
living for possession.  One did not of necessity appear
in the latest fashions in Charleston ball rooms, yet the
balls and the traditions of the society which they
represented went on.  The old city continued in her old
ways.  To a visitor it seemed as if time had been
arrested.  Mr. Heyward was intimately familiar with
it all.  The place, indeed, became a part of him, yet it
did not too entirely possess him.
</p>

<p>
Summers were spent in the mountains of North
Carolina, where he first came into contact with the
"People of the Hills."  There was a brief interlude
of painting about Tryon, N.C., in a "cove" of the
Appalachian ranges that catches the breath of spring
before any of the others.  The lessons of the brush
were afterward remembered by the pen.  Then there
was a season spent in the far West recuperating from
an illness.  This was shortly before the World War.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Heyward's "bit" was done in South Carolina
in organizing war work among the negroes of his
section in co√∂peration with certain gentlemen of Charleston
who were chosen for their knowledge and tact.  It
was an interesting, a valuable, and a vital experience.
In the meanwhile, there were a few short stones.  The
pen had been found.  It was not quite sure yet what
it had to say, but some of the methods of publishing
and the way to an audience had at least become plain.
</p>

<p>
The present writer remembers first meeting Mr. Heyward
only a few months after the Armistice.  He
came into the room one day, naming a mutual literary
acquaintance and a common interest in writing as the
occasion for the call.  He brought with him as his first
impression an unusual sense of ease and
virile-sensitiveness&mdash;an impression that remained.
</p>

<p>
About the hospitable fire of one who was rich in the
lore of the past, literary experience, and living, we
continued to meet.  The result of the association was an
arrangement to collaborate on a book of poems in which
it was agreed to treat some of the legends and the
landscapes about Charleston from various points of view.
Mr. Heyward's literary interest was at that time
mainly in verse and the result was the publication the
following year of <i>Carolina Chansons</i>.
</p>

<p>
During the same year while the poems were underway,
through the able assistance of many friends, there
was organized in Charleston the <i>Poetry Society of
South Carolina</i>.  This in a certain sense proved to be
the spark that kindled the now widely spread interest
in modern poetry in the South.  Requests for advice and
assistance poured into the little "poetry office" at
Charleston, and Mr. Heyward in particular, although
he was then conducting an active business in the city,
found himself called upon for lectures, readings and
literary consultations throughout the South.  It was
in this way, as a poet, that his name first became
generally known.
</p>

<p>
In the meanwhile, he had been dividing his summer
vacations between his own studio-cabin in the North
Carolina Mountains and the MacDowell Colony at
Peterborough, N.H.  Under the combined inspiration
of North and South Carolina landscapes and the
facilities for undisturbed writing provided by the
MacDowell Colony, his first book was followed about a
year later by another volume of poems dealing most
notably with the mountains of North Carolina and the
Low Country of South Carolina.  It was therefore
entitled <i>Skylines and Horizons</i>.
</p>

<p>
His poems had been appearing here and there in
magazines and it was rapidly becoming evident that
Mr. Heyward's real life work lay in the realms of
literature.  The flair toward letters was considerably
strengthened in 1923 by his marriage to Dorothy
Hartzell Kuhns, a professional playwright, and it was
not long afterwards that he definitely severed all active
business connections and retired to write <i>Porgy</i> in the
vicinity of the Big Smokies in North Carolina, where
he owns a small "farm."  The manuscript of <i>Porgy</i>
was put into its final form at the MacDowell Colony
and published in the fall of 1925.  Coincident with
the appearance of his first novel, Mr. Heyward made
a lecture tour through all but the far western states.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Heyward's third book and first novel, <i>Porgy</i>,
which has already been alluded to, is based on some of
the actual adventures in the life of a real negro who
was, until within a very short time, a familiar figure
about the streets of Charleston.  Porgy was a beggar.
He had lost both legs and drove about in a little cart
only a few inches high, behind an olfactorily
memorable goat.  There was no more grotesque, or
picturesque figure in America, and his history, as
Mr. Heyward soon learned, did not belie his appearance.
</p>

<p>
About the story of this colored cripple, who had
played an important role in the life of old Cat-Fish
Row, a venerable and incredible negro tenement along
the Charleston water-front, Mr. Heyward wove his
plot.  It was more than a fine narrative.  It was the
actual life of the colored race, seen through clear eyes,
and enacted in genuine dialect on a stage magnificently
set.  As for the setting in which it takes place, only
those who have seen for themselves the real background
of the book will be able fully to appreciate the
fine restraint with which the artist has gained his
effects.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most significant thing about the book
and its author was the fact that, for the first time,
certainly in this generation, a novel had been written
about the character of an American negro which was at
once true to life and a work of art.  Mr. Heyward did
not regard his material from any standpoint except
that of the literary artist.  He did not pity, patronize,
suggest, assume the white man's burden, or try to add
to or lighten that of the colored man.  In other words,
in <i>Porgy</i>, the author was Du Bose Heyward, writer,
reporting a cross section of human life Ethiopian, in
English prose.  There was no moral propaganda whatever.
Mr. Heyward does not offer his solution of the
"negro problem," nor any scheme to do away with
hurricanes, of which last, by the way, in <i>Porgy</i> there
is the most memorable description of one written by
an American since Gertrude Atherton's <i>Conqueror</i>.
The storm in <i>Porgy</i> is a synthesis of several which the
author witnessed in Charleston, notably the great
hurricane of 1911.  In <i>Skylines and Horizons</i> he had
already treated the theme most successfully in verse.
</p>

<p>
<i>Porgy</i> will very shortly appear in moving pictures,
and a dramatic version upon which the author and his
wife have collaborated will also shortly appear in New
York on the legitimate stage.
</p>

<p>
For the past year or so Mr. Heyward has been
dividing his time between Charleston and his farm
in the North Carolina mountains near Hendersonville
while he has been steadily at work upon his second
novel, <i>Angel</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Angel</i> also treats of a Southern scene, but this time
Mr. Heyward has chosen as the <i>locale</i> of his plot the
mountains, and for his heroine one "Angel," a daughter
of the "People of the Hills."  Through long residence
and association, the author is thoroughly familiar with
his material, and it is to be expected that in <i>Angel</i>,
he will give us a novel of the Poor Whites of the
mountains that will complement his fine and nationally
significant story of the Negro of the Low Country.
